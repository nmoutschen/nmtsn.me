I am a builder who loves to tinker, learn and build things. I am passionate about serverless technologies and software architecture patterns.

This website is a collection of [side-projects](/projects/), experimentations and various resources that can be useful for other builders. Opinions on this website are my own.

## What do I do?

I am a Specialist Solutions Architect for Serverless at [Amazon Web Services](https://aws.amazon.com/), living in Stockholm, Sweden. I help customers design cloud-native architectures. If youâ€™re looking for best-practices, I highly recommend you to read the [Well-Architected Framework whitepapers](https://aws.amazon.com/architecture/well-architected/).

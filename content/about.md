I am a builder and solutions architect who loves to tinker, learn and build things. I am passionate about serverless technologies and software architecture patterns.

This website is a collection of [side-projects](/projects/), experimentations and various resources that can be useful for other builders. Opinions on this website are my own.

## What do I do?

I am a Solutions Architect at [Amazon Web Services](https://aws.amazon.com/) who lives in Stockholm, Sweden. I help customers design cloud-native architectures. If youâ€™re looking for best-practices, I highly recommend you to read the [Well-Architected Framework whitepapers](https://aws.amazon.com/architecture/well-architected/).

My main area of interest is around serverless technologies and how they can help innovate faster while reducing operational burden.

<p>As I spend lot of my time experimenting with backend systems these days, I usually don&rsquo;t have the chance to play around frontend design.</p>

<p>I went through multiple iterations on both the underlying technology as well as the design itself.</p>

<p>You can see the source code running this website on <a href="https://github.com/nmoutschen/nmtsn.me">Github</a>.</p>

<h2 id="technology">Technology</h2>

<p>A colleague of mine gave me the motivation to experiment with <a href="https://vuejs.org/">Vue.js</a>. I started with a new Vue project for the first iteration. However, I quickly realised that managing all articles manually would be bothersome in the long run. While I could&rsquo;ve used <a href="https://vuepress.vuejs.org/">VuePress</a>, I switched to <a href="https://gohugo.io/">Hugo</a> as it is purpose-built for static websites.</p>

<p>I ended up using Vue for other projects, but I prefer to stick to something like Hugo for purely static projects, as I feel it gives me more control over the overall generated content.</p>

<h2 id="design">Design</h2>

<h3 id="first-iteration">First iteration</h3>

<p>I decided to generate a random, moving set of triangles for the background using Perlin noise. I liked the cybernetic look that it gave as the triangles were slowly shifting around.</p>

<p>The background was made of right triangles (two forming a square), with the coordinates of each vertex being slightly shifted according to a 2-dimensional Perlin noise map. The colour of each triangle would also shift slowly overtime between different nuances of light gray.</p>

<h3 id="second-iteration">Second iteration</h3>

<p><img src="/img/nmtsn.me/screenshot2.png" alt="Screenshot of the second iteration" /></p>

<p>During the second iteration, I decided to learn how to use <a href="https://www.sketch.com/">Sketch</a>. This helped me a lot in arranging the different element and build layouts for different types of screens.</p>

<p>I tried to stick to the principles of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Responsive_web_design">Responsive Web Design</a> with a mobile first approach.</p>

<p><img src="/img/nmtsn.me/palette1.png" alt="Palette for the second iteration" /></p>

<p>I also used a much brighter palette, using <a href="https://coolors.co/">Coolors.co</a> for inspiration.</p>

<h3 id="third-iteration">Third iteration</h3>

<p>In the end, having such a saturated background made it difficult to build something suitable for articles. I was also using <a href="https://p5js.org/">P5js</a> for rendering the background and that library size seemed overkill for the desired outcome.</p>

<p><img src="/img/nmtsn.me/palette2.png" alt="Palette for the third iteration" /></p>

<p>I switched to more muted colours and a simpler, one-column design that would switch seamlessly for different screen sizes.</p>
